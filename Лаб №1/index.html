                    A Brief History of Mars
            </h1>
            <p class="text_main">
                    Mars is the fourth planet of the Sonyach system for the most part of the Sun and soma for the world and mass.
                    Named after Mars, the ancient Roman god of war.
                    Sometimes Mars is called a "red planet" because of the reddish color of the surface.
                    Mars is a terrestrial planet with a rarefied atmosphere.
                    On Mars there are meteorite craters, like on Mіsyatsі, volcanoes, valleys and deserts, similar to the earth.
                    Here Mount Olympus (22,456 m) was planted, the most visible mountain in the Sonyachny system,
                    and the Mariner Valley is a majestic rift-like system of canyons.
                    To add to the peculiarities - the period of the wrapping of Mars and the seasonal cycles are also similar to those of the earth.
